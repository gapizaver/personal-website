    <h1>User interface of the Formula student race car</h1>
    <p>In this brief description I will try to present the user interface I developed for the 2022 formula. The UI was
completely redesigned this year. The goal was to use a color LCD and implement multiple screens, which could
be changed from user’s input on the steering wheel. Team’s former cars have 7/14 segment displays, so this was
a big upgrade.</p>
